What do you think being a data scientist is about? 
  In my opion, being a Data scientist means we need to equipped with the expertise in incorporating interdecipline knowledges including programming, statistics as well as machine learning approach to dig out very informative and instructive information from large amount of data to help customers to make decisions for future development.
  
What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas? 
  The major duties of data scientist should include data collection,  transformation and analysis, model selection and evaluation. The knowldge cover extensive areas such as software engineering and Statistics etc.
    
What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians? 
  There both significant differences and similarities between data scientists and statisticians. In terms of similarieties, both data scientists and statisticians need to manipulate data using modeling and statistics approaches. 
  Differences includes
  (1) data size. The data size data scientists are generally larger than that for statistians. 
  (2) terminology. Data scientst usually called observation, predictor and response that statisticians get used to as exa,ple, feature and label respectively. 
  (3) modeling process. Data scientists tend to compare different models to get the optimized one, while statisticians in general start from a simple model and improve it by addressing violation problem.
  
How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?
  I would regard myself as a statistician after graduation and reach a data scientist level by improving programming skills.
