1. what (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do.     
  *It looks like data scientist can do more things than what I initially thought. For example, shiny app and docker container provide great platform to share r codes with users or other r programmers.*   
  
2. what your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?  
  *Of course, I will continue use R because it is so powerful in many applications. The most favorite part is machine learning which provides a fantastic tool to dig out very useful information from big data. The other two attractive application are shinny app and docker container which establish the interaction between data scientist and users.*
   
3. what things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?  
  *I am going to read more materials and combine r programming with my current work. It was recently published that AI can predict protein structure much more precisely than before, displaying extensive application of machine learning where r plays important role. I hope to use r to disease diagnosis e.g cancer which may be related to multiple factors.*
