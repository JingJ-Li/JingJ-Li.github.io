QAs about R
Q:Everyone in this course had some programming experience coming in (due to the prerequisites). What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used? 
A: R have a couples of advantages over other softwars:
  (1) R is free. which is more popular among non professional people than some commercial software e.g. SAS. 
  (2) R is easy to use and serve many purposes like calcuator without complicated programs. 
  (3) R is very flexiable due to availabilty of various packages and its functions can be expanded by addition of extra packages contributed by R programmer all over the world. 
      To my experience, SAS sounds lack such kind of flexibility.
Q: What functionality do you like about R? 
A: Most favorite functionlity is the friendly and beatiful interfaces. For example, using R markdown, plain text, code and runing results can be combined harmoniously. 
   Many kinds output forms are compatible with R markdown such as pdf, word, html, ppt etc. 

Q: What parts do you miss about your other language? 
A: SAS certificate is favorable for data science career. It is uncertain if there is a similar certificate for R.

Q: Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? (If you knew R prior to the course, describe your experience when first learning it.)
A: Yes, so far I feel challenging to learn R. Probing into brain to dig out tons of R funtions and combing them for complicated work is really hard for me.
